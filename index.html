      <br>
      <h2>Major Project Part A</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>
        In the beginning we brainstormed for ideas as group not individuals. Within the group, each  member had to come up with at least five ideas which we then sorted and grouped similar ideas. After that we walked around other groups and voted the best ideas. One of the idea that i came up with was to have the guessing questionnaire game that is related to the Ships that the convicts came in, the ships would sink if the user got the question wrong.Here are the top two ideas from our group.

        <br><br>
        We eventually decided to create quiz games game. In the earlier stage of Part A Me and my groupmates knew what API we would use but we weren’t sure how we would do it.

        <img src="./images/api_brainstorm.jpg"alt="">
        <br><br>
        After selecting the basic idea we brainstormed on how we will create the layout, after several ideas such as a jail cell, a “hut” in a the australian coast , on a ship etc. we decided upon a basic room with furnitures inside that we can click to reveal clues and then the user would use those clues to answer the question.
        <br><br>

        Here a rough flowchart that describes the gameplay and the user inout and the system output of the game

        <br><br>
        In part A it was mostly gourp based tasks, however, there was some individual tasks. I was responsible for the designing a poster for our pitch. I think I did a great job as all myteam members were pleased with it.

      <h2>Major Project Part B</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>
        In part B we did our paper prototyping and I was the observer  for majority of the part.Some of the key observations I made about the users are the following
        <ul>
          <li>User seemed a bit confused at first about the context and goal of the program (required some explanation from the facilitator)</li>
          <li>Tell the user what they’re looking for, give more context on the game and subject</li>
          <li>Start page / home page</li>
          <li>Instructions for how the game works</li>
          <li>Possibly have a timer to have an urgency in the gameplay</li>
          <li>Have question either given at the start or have accessible at all times</li>
          <li>Let the user answer the question as soon as they have the information</li>
        </ul>
        After our prototyping we immediately  began our development of our website and incorporating the feedback that was given to us. Which were basically the issues I observed in the dot points above. Each team member was assigned a specific task , I was responsible for the the front end development ( HTML & CSS). I got the coding completed in time, however, some alterations needed to be made at the end hence not meeting our personal deadlines for the progress report although we did manage to meet the part be deadline for submission of our report.
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        It is in this section we realised some of major problems with ourprototype. such as lack of direction, lack of context, lack of urgency in the game, the answer system,
        <br><br>
        <img src="./images/prototype.png"alt="">
        <br><br>
        As mentioned above I was responsible for creating the designing the front end. here is the erliest version of the structure.
        <br><br>

      <h2>Major Project Part C</h2>
      <h3>
        In this part we finalised all our codes. One of the group members was not confident with doing the styling part so In part C I decided to do the markup and the styling for the document.
        <br>Here is a picture of our final product.
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        This was the final stretch of the project where we had some hiccups amongst our team but we managed to solve the problem as a team. Even Though if this meant I had to cover for HTML and CSS section of the game it was the best decision for the team. I did all the JavaScript for the visuals of our game.
        Here is the our final work plan.
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        I also designed the wiggle function of the game which was very popular during the trade show.

      <h2>Course Reflection</h2>
      <h3>
        Looking at my journey throughout DECO1800, I can confidently say I have learned many usefull skills which will come handyin the future.
        <br><br>
        Firstly, one of the biggest things that I learnt in this course is how to work as a part of a team. It was a very real world experience. I learnt to rely and trust on the rest of my teammates, resolve team conflicts and conceptualize and brainstorm idea within the team.
        <br><br>
        Secondly, I have a much deeper understanding of the design process, and how a developer will interact with clients and team members to synthesize and final product.
        <br>
        Looking back I one thing I would say is that I will need to manage my time more efficiently and take in count potential mess ups and failures.
        <br><br>
        I believe that DECO1800 was overall an effective course,  in the way that it allowed me to experience design process firsthand and learn about real world process.
